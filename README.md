# Chess Assistant
 
Welcome to the Chess Assistant project! This Python project aims to create a chess-playing assistant that provides move recommendations based on a neural network model.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
- Python 3.x
- [python-chess](https://python-chess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)

```bash
pip install python-chess torch
````
## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chess-assistant.git
    cd chess-assistant
    ```

2. **Download the pre-trained model weights and place them in the project directory.**
## Usage

Run the main script to start the chess assistant:

```bash
python chess_assistant.py
````
> Follow the on-screen instructions to make moves, and the assistant will provide recommendations. The game continues until it's over.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the neural network model, architecture, and training process according to your preferences and requirements. Replace the placeholder neural network in `ChessModel` with your own model.
